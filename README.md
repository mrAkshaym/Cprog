This is how internally clang builds.
Syntax: clang-cl.exe main.cpp -o main.exe

Info:
clang-cl.exe is a version of the Clang compiler designed to be compatible with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (cl.exe). It allows developers to use Clang with the same command-line arguments and environment as cl.exe, making it easier to integrate Clang into existing Visual Studio projects12.

Essentially, clang-cl.exe provides the benefits of Clangâ€™s modern compiler technology while maintaining compatibility with the MSVC toolchain3. This includes support for MSVC flag syntax, library search paths, and ABI (Application Binary Interface)3.
